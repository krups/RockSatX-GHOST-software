\section{FemptoSats Requirements}
\par The FemptoSats submission is to test the viability of using Wifi/LoRa for intercapsuole communication. 

\subsection{Sensors Requirements}
\par The FemptoSats will have the following sensors: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item BME280 Temperature/pressure/humidity sensor
    \item BNO086 9 - Axis IMU
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{BME280 Temperature/pressure/humidity sensor}
\par The BME280 will be run with the following configuration settings: 

\subsubsection{BNO086 9 - Axis IMU}
\par The BNO086 will be run with the following configuration settings:

\subsection{Wireless Communcation Requirements}
\par the FemptoSat will use the following Wireless Communcation modules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Integrated Wifi
    \item LoRa
\end{itemize}
\par The Wifi will fail over to the LoRa when the Wifi gets out of range
